I was born in Nizhny Novgorod. It is my hometown.
I have been living here all my life. Let me tell you more about it.
It is a very lively place, located in Central Russia. It was founded
in 1221. Back then it used to be a major trading hub. People
 from all over the country came to Nizhny Novgorod to buy and sell goods.
Now it has a population of one million and five hundred thousand citizens,
it is the 6th biggest city in Russia.
